# Mid Terms In Class Build

Work with ONE other person as a team, or alternatively work on your own with 2 github
accounts (if you have them).
Create a Github repo with a ReadMe file; add your partner as a collaborator.
You will be building a 1-page app. Pick a subject that you can disagree about - both points of
view should appear in the final submission. As an example, one person could argue that dogs
are best, the other person could argue that in fact cats are WAY better than dogs.
Create a simple page with images and text. Divide the page into two sections, using the
SECTION element. The first section is arguing FOR, the second is arguing AGAINST. Each
team member will use one of the section elements to express their point of view.
Create a conflict with your teammate before you get too far into the assignment; resolve it. Take
a screenshot of the conflict details and submit that wth your repo.
Make sure you merge everything to master and submit the link.

Use what we’ve covered so far (Terminal, Git and Github) to create a simple 1-page HTML
application. A few paragraphs of text for each point of view and at least one image for each is
required.
One team member must create a repository on Github with a Readme. Add your partner as a
collaborator. Put the appropriate information in the readme file (this will be basic, because it’s a
simple 1-off).
Each team member will create a branch and add their argument / position and image(s) to the
app. Merge everything to the master branch when you’re finished. Do code reviews before
you merge!
Push the finished files to your repo, double check to make sure you’ve merged everything to
the master branch and submit the repo URL to the FOL dropbox.
